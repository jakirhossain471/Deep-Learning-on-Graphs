This repository contains a brief lecture on deep learning on graph data. An end to end comparison with Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and Graph Convolutional Network(GCN). 
Basic working mechanisms of neural network and graph neural network have been discussed with easy to undersatnd graphical illustrations.
Additionally a project that solves practical froblem, "Line Failure Detection in Power Grid using Graph Convolutional Network" have also been discussed and full codes are provided.
I designed this as a mini course to provide as a day trainning in NSF Cyber Trainning Bootcamp 2021, FAU.
